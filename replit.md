### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run start`: Start production server
- `npm run db:push`: Push database schema changes

### Production Considerations
- Uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalability
- Express serves both API and static files
- Environment-specific configuration for development vs production
- Error handling and logging for production debugging

The application is designed to be easily deployable on platforms like Replit, Vercel, or any Node.js hosting service with PostgreSQL support.
